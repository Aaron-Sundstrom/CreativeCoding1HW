  What an incredible lecture! I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. Randy Pausch’s use of humor and insight into his own life was a wonderful overcast to an otherwise dreary topic. From anecdotes of his early life 
and dreams to fulfilling them (or in the case of one specific dream, just meeting the guy who inspired it) paints a very empowering image of the possibilities available if you work hard and try your best to “live your 
life right”. I think the part that affected me the most was the talk about “walls” and examples of what he did to overcome them, and most importantly that some of those walls he could not overcome on his own! Sometimes 
you need help up and over the wall to continue your path to your dreams. While he takes a slightly Tony Robbins-esque slant to his description of what walls are, I think that the important takeaway is that even though a 
wall is placed in front of you, they can be conquered. 

  I think one part that really resonated with me was the overtone of helping others, whether that be helping them achieve their dreams or just helping them along in their journey. I am a big believer that everyone could
use help in one way or another and part of being a good neighbor is being willing to help others. I really liked the bar graph of “fun to work with” that he showed and the reason he created it. The importance of being 
nice to work with and collaborate with is very important regardless of what field you go into and is a very important life skill. For those of us with a mind of going into a creative technology field it's doubly important
Most avenues in those fields require work with a team or pods that all contribute to a bigger product or picture. 

  Overall I really enjoyed a look into the life of Randy Pausch, and I think that there is a wealth of lessons to be gleaned from the lecture.
