  I feel very strongly that there are far more important factors to learning than learning styles, and I agree with the mountain of research pointing to the fact that learning styles donâ€™t have an impact on performance.
I do, however, think that from a standpoint of comfort, learning styles do impact a person. In high school I was absolutely convinced that learning styles were the most important thing in all education and that would 
explain why I felt most confident in certain classes and not others. However, I now realize that what made me feel more confident in those classes was that the learning style was one that made me feel comfortable. 
When I was in a class that was very lecture and note intensive, I felt more in my element, felt more comfortable and thus felt that I could react and ask questions more, felt a positive connection and a want to learn
more about those classes. The real myth of learning styles shattered for me after high school when I went into the working world

  I have worked several different types of jobs in all types of fields, from the bottom rung to the very top of middle management and learning styles are not a thing in the working world. Often you are thrown into 
the deep end and expected to sink or swim. This is obviously not a good or even morally okay way of training someone, but it did teach me that adjusting my mindset to the job at hand was more important than needing
it taught to me in a certain way. I think a lot of this turns back to the video on growth mindset. In a working and school environment It is far more important to foster an idea of growth rather than pass or fail. 
At jobs where you can make little mistakes and learn from them without immediately being thrown under the bus, you learn more and are able to utilize that knowledge farther than if you are taught with a scolding.
