            <p style="font-style: initial;">I hope you enjoy the website and the navigation bar which took me quite a while to learn how to do for my other class. This page is an amalgamation of sections and bits and bobs I used just this week and last in that class, all rolled into one!</p>

            What's interesting is that some of the stuff we are doing this week in this class is stuff we are learning in 2-3 weeks in the other class, so thank you for the Leg Up!
