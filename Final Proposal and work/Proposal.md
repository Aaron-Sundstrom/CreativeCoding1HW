Hello there! My proposal is for a 2d sidescrolling action game with the hooks of finding pieces of a relic (or sword) to defeat the final boss! I have submitted along with my proposal some of the work I have already completed for the mechanics of various systems. Please also refer to my ramblings vis a vie the overview.txt. 

I have begun to work on the sprites for the game as that will be the primary visual element. I am confident I can complete all of it by the time it is due as most of the heavy coding work has been completed. I have the ability to cycle screans if the player crosses the edge, can draw screens very easily and have enemy behavior worked out. All that is left is gravity (which I think I have figured out just have not coded it yet), final sprite work, and hitboxes.
