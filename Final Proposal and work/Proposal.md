Hello there! My proposal is for a 2d sidescrolling action game with the hooks of finding pieces of a relic (or sword) to defeat the final boss! I have submitted along with my proposal some of the work I have already completed for the mechanics of various systems. Please also refer to my ramblings vis a vie the overview.txt. The main idea is that the player will go around from screen to screen (that changes as they move past the edge of the screen through the use of a ticker and multiple predrawn screens.) and find the pieces to unlock the door to the final area (boss or no).

I have begun to work on the sprites for the game as that will be the primary visual element. I am confident I can complete all of it by the time it is due as most of the heavy coding work has been completed. I have the ability to cycle screans if the player crosses the edge, can draw screens very easily and have enemy behavior worked out. All that is left is gravity (which I think I have figured out just have not coded it yet), final sprite work, and hitboxes. 

Some of my inspiration is coming from a lot of old RPG maker games that I have played in the past and things like Jump King, Shovel Knight and dead cells. 

As stated before I have worked out several things related to this project and am working on the rest as we speak. As of now I have a way to track HP for both enemies and the player, a way to move and jump and am working on perfecting the gravity and collision of the level so you can actually move on the platform. I have a way to easily generate enemies and platforms as needed through the use of classes. 

The major issue I currently have is with the gravity and collision but I think I have solved the workaround. As I am not building a tile map it is difficult to do checks around the player for if an object is solid or not so instead I will have arrays that hold the locations of platforms and will be position checked in the player class. 

I have already had to do quite a bit of outside research to make some of this work and am very happy and looking forward to this project. My sincere hope is to finish with all the coding and level design by Wednesday of this week and have the rest of the time to dedicate to sprite work. 

I have some goals that I would love to reach if time permits but are not necessary, I saw that there are ways to do almost like cutscenes in p5.js that I would very much like to utilize but again its not a priorty.
