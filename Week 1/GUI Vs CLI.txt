	Two options for viewing, organizing and manipulating folders and files are a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Command Line Interface (CLI). While the two are functionally similar, allowing a user to perform these actions there are fundamental differences in how you go about making these changes as well as the power available to you between the two. 

	As a Mac user the GUI comes in the form of Finder, allowing the user to quickly and easily change and create files and folders through the use of visual context actions. These visual context actions allow a user with a relatively low knowledge of computer basics to perform actions as needed. With a simple right click a user can rename, create, and organize folders as needed as well are rename files. 

	The CLI offers the same abilities albeit through the use of commands typed into your command line. While being slightly more esoteric to the average user, the command line offers a more powerful and robust system or data manipulation to files and folders. A user knowledgable in the mystical art of command usage would be able to out perform a user using just a GUI interface. One notable way is that by default on a Mac (at least in the case of this humble users computer) saving a file using textedit and its GUI will save it as a "Rich Text File" instead of a standard .txt file, requiring you to go through the settings and changing the defaults before creating a txt file. With the use of the command line and the "touch" command one can quickly and easily create a txt file in a quarter of the time.
